#### Update notes
Version 0.14 modifies the [`connect()`](https://docs.rs/message-io/latest/message_io/network/struct.NetworkController.html#method.connect) behaviour to perform a
[non-blocking connections](https://github.com/lemunozm/message-io/issues/79) instead.
It is recommended to use this non-blocking mode in order to get the
best scalability and performance in your application. If you need to perform
a similar blocking connection as before (version 0.13), you can call to [`connect_sync()`](https://docs.rs/message-io/latest/message_io/network/struct.NetworkController.html#method.connect_sync).

Note also that the previous `NetEvent::Connect` has been renamed to `NetEvent::Accepted`.
The current `NetEvent::Connect` behaves as a new event to deal with the new non-blocking connections.
See [`NetEvent`](https://docs.rs/message-io/latest/message_io/network/enum.NetEvent.html) docs for more info.

## Release 0.13.3
- Fixed a bad internal assert.

## Release 0.13.2
- Added `Endpoint::from_listener()` that allows to send datagrams from listeners in non connection-oriented protocols (see the API docs).
- Removed `'static` restriction in the `NodeListener::for_each()` callback.
Now, you can pass references to the callback.
- Faster compilation. Reduced some dependencies.
- Faster `NodeHandler` clone and less memory usage in each instance.

## Release 0.13.1
- Added `NodeListener::enqueue()`.

## Release 0.13.0
- Updated `NodeListener::for_each` to works fully synchronous. `Send` trait of the event callback parameter has been removed to works fine with objects like `Rc` `Cell` or references.
This function no longer returns a `NodeTask`.
- New method `NodeListener::for_each_async` has been added to support the previous behaviour of
`for_each`.
- Added `Debug` to `NodeEvent`.

## Release 0.12.2
- Reduced *WebSocket* latency.

## Release 0.12.1
- *WebSocket* now can returns when send correctly a `SendStatus::MaxPacketSizeExceeded` instead of `ResourceNotFound` if the packet size is exceeded.
- *UDP* has increases the packet size when send.
  Now more bytes per packet can be sent if the OS let it.
- Exported some adapter constants dependent.
- `Transport::max_message_size()` now represents the teorical maximum size (see its related docs).

## Release 0.12.0
- Node concept: `NodeHandler` and `NodeListener`.
- Non-mutable and shared network operations.
- Removed AdapterEvent. Now, the only network event is NetEvent that has been modified to contains a reference to the data instead of an allocated vector.
- Removed `Network` entity that has been substituted by `NetworkController` to handle connect/listen/remove/send and `NetworkProcessor` to handle the input events.
- Remamed `EventQueue`to `EventReceiver`.
- Minor API additions.
- Now UDP never generates disconnection events.
- Increased performance:
  - Latency reduced in arround 66%.
  - Zero-copy message.

#### Update notes
Version 0.12 comes with important API changes (changelog) in order to reach zero-copy write/read goal.
For a soft transition, you can use `NodeListener::enqueue()` (see docs).

## Release 0.11.1
- Reduce the bandwidth of `FramedTcp` transport using variadic encoding instead of constant padding.

## Release 0.11.0
- Implemented `Serialize`/`Deserialize` for `Transport`.
- Implemented `Serialize`/`Deserialize` for `RemoteAddr`.
- Changed `Url` to `String` in `RemoteAddr`.
- Changed `RemoteAddr` variant from `SocketAddr` to `Socket`.
- Changed `RemoteAddr` variant from `Url` to `Str`.
- Increase the `ToRemoteAddr` support for many types.
- Returned value of `Netowork::remove()` as boolean.
  Rationale: Removing a connected connection
  could return `None` in the previous version of `remove` if just a disconnection happen.
  The user probably will use `.unwrap()` on it adding a potential bug.
  Changing from `Option<()>` to `bool` avoid this usage.
- Added `RegisterId` of the listener which generates the connection in `AdapterEvent::Added`
and `NetEvent::Connection` events.

## Release 0.10.2
- Added `try_receive()` to `EventQueue` for non-blocking event read.
- tests and benchmarks running with any number of features enabled.

## Release 0.10.1
- Transport by features: `tcp`, `udp`, `websocket`.

## Release 0.10.0
- Renamed `Transport::Tcp` as `Transport::FramedTcp`.
  **WARNING**: If previously you was using `Transport::Tcp` you probably want to use now
  `Transport::FramedTcp` (that behaves the same).
- Added `Transport::Tcp` that has no encoding layer. Now `Transport::Tcp` is purely TCP.
- Renamed `Transport::max_payload()` to `Transport::max_message_size()`.
- Added `Endpoint` into `AdapterEvent`.
- Fixed `ResourceId` compilation in 32-bits.
- Reverted inner tuple position of `Network::split()` in version 0.8.
  First `Network` then `EventQueue`, as an user would expect.

#### Update notes
If you comming from **0.9.4 o less**, note that `Transport::Tcp` has been renamed
to `Transport::FramedTcp` to be more according to its behaviour.
See more [here](https://docs.rs/message-io/latest/message_io/network/enum.Transport.html).

## Release 0.9.4

## Release 0.9.0
- Removed serialization. **Rationale:**
  The serialization inside `message-io` was merely a shortcut,
  than in most of the cases reduced the power of the user by save 2-3 lines of their code.
  The serialization should be handle by the user for several reasons:
    - The user could want to decide send the message in base of the serialized data size.
      (e.g. chosing a diffenrent transports if the serialized size exceeds the max packet size)
    - The user could want to perform some action over raw data.
    - The user could make a gateway without needed to deserialize to serialize again.
    - Or simply, there is no need to serialize in some cases.
- `Network::remove_resource()` to `Network::resource()`.
- Exposed `AdapterEvent`.
- Added `Network::split_and_map()`.
